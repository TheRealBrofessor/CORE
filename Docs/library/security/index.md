# Security Reference Hub

## Core model
Security = managing **risk** by controlling:
- **identity** (who/what)
- **access** (can they do it)
- **exposure** (is it reachable)
- **impact** (what happens if compromised)
- **detection** (will you notice)

## Foundations
- Threat modeling (assets, actors, attack paths)
- AuthN vs AuthZ
- Least privilege
- Secure defaults
- Logging and incident response
