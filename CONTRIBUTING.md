# Contributing to CORE

CORE is a structured, community-owned learning resource for computer science, coding, cybersecurity, cloud, and AI.
Consistency matters more than volume.

## Quick Start
1. Pick an issue (or open one)
2. Create a branch: `feat/<short-name>` or `fix/<short-name>`
3. Add **one** note/lab/cheatsheet per PR
4. Use the appropriate template in `/templates`
5. Open a PR and complete the checklist

## Where Things Go
- Notes: `Docs/notes/<level>/<domain>/...`
  - levels: `beginner | intermediate | advanced`
  - domains: `cs | linux | networking | web | databases | cloud | security | ai`
- Labs: `Docs/notes/labs/`
- Cheatsheets: `Docs/notes/cheatsheets/`

## Note Rules (Non-Negotiable)
- One concept per note (no mega-dumps)
- Use kebab-case filenames (e.g., `tcp-vs-udp.md`)
- Write in clear, practical language
- Include at least one example (code, command, or worked scenario)
- Add at least 1–2 references when applicable (official docs preferred)
- Add “Related Notes” links if any exist

## Pull Request Checklist
